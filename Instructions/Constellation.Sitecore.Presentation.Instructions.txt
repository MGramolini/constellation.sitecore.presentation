============

This is a Model-View-Presenter framework.

Typically the Models are strongly-typed Items. Out of the box this library supports (and requires) Constellation.Sitecore.Items

Views are either Web Custom Controls or Web User Controls. They should descend from the appropriate base View class.

Presenters descend from IPresenter. The Default presenter expects the View's datasource to be resolved to a Constellation Item, which
is passed to the corresponding view.

Example:

MyBodyCopyView<IContentPage> : UserControlView

will cause the default presenter to return the Context Item as a custom type of IContentPage back to the View. This IContentPage object
will be the MyBodyCopyView.ViewModel property value.

Views can suport any type of ViewModel, as long as there is a Presenter that also supports the same TModel. Note that each TModel type
can only be supported by one Presenter, so plan accordingly.
